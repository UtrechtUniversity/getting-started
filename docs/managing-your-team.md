Before adding a repository to your team, you must create it. To do so, navigate to https://github.com/new and fill in the form. 
For `Owner` select "Utrecht University". In programmer fashion you can choose a name that is a wordplay or pun. You can also deviate from this and choose a name that best describes your project in 1 word.

## Additional information

- A team can have subteams, but generally speaking it is advised to keep the structure as simple as possible and not to introduce hierarchies where they are not necessary
- Repositories can be completely private from the outside world, but in the interest of open science, they really should not be
- Within a team you can start forum-like discussions. This is a good place to ask if anybody knows how to perform a certain operation as the answer will be perserved and if anyone in the future then ends up needing the same information it can be searched for and found
- For questions and problems related directly to a repository, it is best ot make an issue on the repository level, not the team level
