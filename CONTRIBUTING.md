# Contributing

We are very happy with any suggestions or contributions to improve the contents. The aim of this Repository is to help UU employees getting started with the Utrecht University Github organization. 

## How to contribute

#### Issues
The easiest way to contribute is to submit an [issue](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/getting-started/issues), and make your comments about contents, typos or any other suggestions.

#### Pull requests
If you are comfortable with git and pull requests, you can also submit a pull request where you directly suggest changes to the content. Read more about how pull requests work [here](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

In short:

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository.
3. Commit the change in that branch.
4. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub
5. Submit a pull request from that branch to the main branch of the master repository. 
6. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

#### Use an editorial style guide for writing, preferably the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
